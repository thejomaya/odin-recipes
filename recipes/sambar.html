<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Sambar or sambhar is a lentil based stew mixed with vegetable and tamarind juice. once the lentil soup comes to a boil, it is then mixed with spice powder known as sambar powder. also, sambar is incomplete without vegetables. while any vegetables can be added to sambar. however, drumstick is a must in any south indian sambar recipe. furthermore, the sambar soup is then tempered with the tempering agents, before serving it with rice.</p>
<p>Probably sambar was my dish i learnt to prepare after my marriage. while i was staying with my parents, i use to hardly cook. well i can say that i knew the basics before my marriage. i used to spend most of my time in kitchen chit chatting with my mother. she use to teach me with all the recipes and techniques. perhaps, she knew what was coming for me after marriage. my mother use to stress one main thing for any recipe. all the recipes are combination 4 different tastes. basically, balance the sourness, sweetness, salt and spiciness of any dish.</p>
